# ADM Homework 05 - Group #18

Roberta Passarelli - Giorgio Zannini Quirini

Our goal is to analyse the `Wikipedia Hyperlink graph`: we will rank the pages knowing that they belong to a certain category.

For this purpose we use the Wikipedia graph released by the SNAP group. 

## Getting data to analyze
The data in usage are taken from [Wikicat hyperlink graph](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ghPJ4g6XMCUDFQ2JPqAVveLyytG8gBfL/view), a reduced version of the one on the SNAP site.

From [this](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/wiki-topcats.html) page we download: 
- `wiki-topcats-categories.txt`
- `wiki-topcats-page-names.txt`

## Script description
